##########First Git Project###############
1.create project direcory and just enter into it--- mkdir,cd, ls -l command will work fine here
2.git init #for initialize the Git Project(Default branch will be master, you will learn more about branching)

add some file in your directory
3.git add . #(add all for commit). Before firing this 'git add' command you can also
check status of file if they are added to commit or not. If you have not added newly file you will find the below message for newly added file
$ git status
On branch master

Initial commit

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        GitHelp.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

Here we are adding for just staging the chnages for commit
Working copy>staging area>repository
4. git commit -m "Added GitHelp.txt" #commiting the change and -m is here for message
5. Alternate way of adding and commit 'git commit -a' and enter your message and exit the editor
Note: It is good practic to fire the check everytime at the end of the day if we have anything to commit or not.
Just fir command "git status" and you will find below message on screen.
$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
############Other Command ##################
